        Prioritizing research into the safety of decision-making systems will pave the way for the swift and responsible real-world deployment of cutting-edge advancements. As a PhD Candidate at McGill University's Mobile Robotics Lab, my research focuses on robust imitation learning, with a special emphasis on two key areas: out-of-distribution recovery and generalization through dynamical systems. I enjoy working with diverse robotic systems, deploying carefully designed imitation policies to a wide range of manipulator arms and locomotion platforms. My work is not just about advancing theory; itâ€™s about ensuring the practical deployment of safe and reliable policies across various robotic applications.
