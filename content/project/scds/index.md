[**Ongoing Project**] Learning unconstrained and stable imitation policies from state-only expert demonstrations applicable to a variety of robotic platforms. Experiments and simulations are entirely conducted in Nvidia Isaac Lab and Isaac Gym. The project is funded by a competitive scholarship from the Swiss National Centres of Competence in Research ([NCCR Automation](https://nccr-automation.ch/about/people/amin-soleimani-abyaneh)) in collaboration with [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/).
