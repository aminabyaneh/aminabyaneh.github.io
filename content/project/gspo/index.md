[**Ongoing Project**] Learning model-free reinforcement learning policies with internal safety and stability guarantees mainly for manipulation and locomotion tasks. The experiments leverage domain randomization and sim-to-real capabilities of Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab simulators. The project is in collaboration with Mitacs, funded by the [Mitacs Accelerate Fellowship](https://www.mitacs.ca/our-programs/accelerate-fellowship-students-postdocs/) and an industrial partner, [Sycodal Electronics Inc](https://sycodal.ca/fr/).
